# Particle Lights Simulator

Each chime is a "particle" in this system.

## TODO
- [x] Implement "transmission" effects
- [x] Implement transmission with delay
- [x] Transmission should not make neighbours start on black (return None rather than progress=0. for delayed start)
- [ ] Display FPS
- [ ] Output ArtNet
- [ ] Load/save settings
- [ ] Load custom, specific arrangement of chimes
- [ ] Plot selected ease curves on GUI
- [ ] Allow for non-linear mapping of brightness ("real" brightness -> "boosted-shadows" brightness, for example)
